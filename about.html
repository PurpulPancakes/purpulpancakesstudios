        <p>
            Purpul Studios was founded by Marcus Tinney, otherwise known as PurpulPancakes 
            online. He grew up loving video games, starting with a Nintendo 64 and quickly 
            loving every second of it. He was greatly inspired by Nintendo and hopes to 
            eventually become a part of Nintendo to help out with future games and bring 
            joy to those who play video games that he helped create! In the meantime, he 
            wanted to create his own video games to get a better understanding of how they 
            are created. Starting with small projects in class and slowly growing to bigger 
            and much better games!
