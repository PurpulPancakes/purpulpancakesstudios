                Purpul Studios is a video game company by gamers, for gamers! Our goal 
                is to create lifelong memories of people enjoying video games, whether they are
                playing it together, or by themselves! We know the joys of playing games, and
                it would be our honor to make others happy playing our video games! Our games 
                would be for all types of players, not too difficult for the new players, and
                not to easy for the veteran players! We will strive to create the best home
                gaming experience!
